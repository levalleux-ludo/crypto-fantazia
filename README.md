# Crypto Fantasia

A decentralized board game about economics (think about Monopoly) but crypto-oriented, where crypto-economics mechanisms are entirely implemented by smart contract on the Tezos blockchain.

## Description

Welcome to Crypto Fantasia.

In this game, you are a serial entrepreneur in the blockchain space.
Roll the dices, move forward your avatar on the board and, depending on the space where you arrive:
- found, buy or sell a crypto startup,
- launch an ICO,
- invest in developing new features and MVPs,
- stake your money to get interests,
- get rewards from crypto-mining,
- run an exchange, a marketplace or a bounty platform
- took a chance or invoke your community chest
- ...

Play good, be lucky, develop a winning business strategy, manage well your wealth and you'll succeed.
Mostly decentralized, all economics mechanisms of the game are implemented by smart-contracts on the Tezos blockchain, from the game currency (fungible token use as 'money') to startup and other assets (non fungible token), to chance and community chest cards, marketplaces and exchanges.

## Why this game ?

I've developed this game with the idea that the new economical mechanisms brought by the blockchain ecosystem (namely DeFi) provide us (software developers) with a fresh new and exciting playground, and quite funny as well (think about the DeFi lego).
So could a 'mainstream' game allow others (non-technical people) to discover, explore, understand, and play with these new tools and paradigms, to better assess what's going on ?
And it became obvious that, while the so famous Monopoly game has learnt all of us about traditional capitalist economics (mortgages, investments, good/bad fortune, wealth management, etc), a similar approach could be used to educate everyone, in a playful way, with this new world of crypto-economics.
